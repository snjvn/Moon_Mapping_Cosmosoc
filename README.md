Problem:
**Development of an AI/ML model to generate high (~30 cm) resolution
lunar terrain image from medium/low (5 m / 10 m) resolution terrain image.**

TMC-2 has covered 80% of the Moon's Surface however the resolution of images are very low (~5m ). OHRC has nearly 20% of the surface covered with a very high resolution of images(~ 28cm)
